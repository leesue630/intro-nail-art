### Materials List

For this course, **you will need**:

- two colors of nail polishes
- nail art brush
- nail polish remover

You will have the choice of either:
1. **paying a course fee** in exchange for **certain course materials to keep**,
2. **paying a reduced course fee** in exchange for **access to certain course materials to share**,
3. or **purchasing and providing your own materials** to use and keep.

Note:
- Some materials will be provided by the course, regardless of whether you pay a course fee or not. It goes without saying that **you may purchase and use any materials that you wish**.
- We expect that the opt-in course fee will range anywhere from $5 to $10+. We will send an email to registered students a couple weeks prior to the start of the semester to survey interest in the course fee.

As of *7/12/2021*, we are still in the process of ironing out:
- the exact price(s) of the course fee,
- what materials will be provided to all,
- and what materials will be provided in exchange for paying the course fee.

For a more comprehensive breakdown of these materials, product recommendations, and a whole lot of other optional (but fun) materials, see this [post](_posts/2021-09-01-materials.md).

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to either of us through email.

Students will create their own nail art design for the final project. This project will be due the last day of class and students are expected to present their design to the class.

### Attendance Policies

Students are expected to attend every class. Students that have more than 2 unexcused absences will automatically fail the course. This is a strict policy. Students with legitimate reasons to miss class should inform the instructors in advance as soon as possible.

We will take attendance through in-person attendance.

Religious observance, illness, job interviews, etc. are valid excuses for an excused absence.
