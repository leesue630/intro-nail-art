### Materials List

For this course, **you will need**:

- at least two colors of nail polishes
- nail art brush
- dotting tool
- nail polish remover

For a more comprehensive breakdown of these materials, product recommendations, and a whole lot of other optional (but fun) materials, see [this post](_posts/2021-09-01-materials.md).

**Update**: We will be providing _all necessary materials_ for the class to share, thanks to a generous budget extension by the StuCo committee. In other words, there will be no course fee! ü•≥

However, because a budget is still a budget, our supplies are on the cheaper end and are limited in quantity (i.e. we will have to take turns using some of the supplies).

That being said, if you would like to use your own materials, feel free to purchase and/or bring them to class! We highly encourage it!

### Grades

| **Assessment** | **Percentage of Final Grade** |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Participation  | 80%                           |
| Midterm        | 10%                           |
| Final Project  | 10%                           |

..

#### Participation

In-person attendance will be recorded every class.

#### Midterm

The midterm will be a multiple-choice assessment that will go over how to create various designs using the techniques and tools that we have discussed.

#### Final

Students will create their own nail art design for the final project. This project will be due the last day of class and students are expected to present their design to the class.

---

### Attendance Policies

Students are expected to attend every class. Students that have more than 2 unexcused absences will automatically fail the course. This is a strict policy. Students with legitimate reasons to miss class should inform the instructors in advance as soon as possible.

We will take attendance through in-person attendance.

Religious observance, illness, job interviews, etc. are valid excuses for an excused absence.

### Waitlisted Students

If you are on the waitlist, unfortunately you may not attend class in person.

Due to COVID-19 room capacity restrictions, we have been told to stick to allowing in-person attendance only to students who are registered for the course. Only once you get off the waitlist and become fully registered may you attend class in person.

Feel free however to follow along with the material at home by checking out our weekly Google Slides presentations, which we will link in the above schedule after each class.

### Class Discord

We've spun up a Discord for more relaxed inter-class communication. We'll share the link during class, but e-mail us if you miss it and would like to join!

## Course Showcase

Send a message in the Discord's `#showcase` channel for your out-of-class nail art work to be shared on the website's [Showcase page](https://leesue630.github.io/intro-nail-art/showcase/)! Most showcase submissions by the end of the semester win a special prize ü§≠!
