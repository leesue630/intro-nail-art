### Attendance Policies

Students are expected to attend every class. Students that have more than 2 unexcused absences will automatically fail the course. This is a strict policy. Students with legitimate reasons to miss class should inform the instructors in advance as soon as possible.

We will take attendance through in-person attendance.

Religious observance, illness, job interviews, etc. are valid excuses for an excused absence.
