  ## Syllabus ðŸŽ¨
---

With nail art, self-expression is right at our fingertips. Together, we will dive into not only how to paint various nail art designs, but we will also discuss the origins of nail art and past nail art trends. Each week, we will learn and practice a new design technique. By the end of the course, you will have your very own nail salon right at home.
