### Nail Care

**Nail Polish Remover**
- Most nail polish removers (a.k.a. acetone polish removers) found at your local drugstore or retail store will be effective at their job.
- Consider buying non-acetone polish removers if you intend on frequently painting and cleaning your nails, as acetone can dry out your skin if used often. Acetone, however, is most effective at removing nail polish.
- Read [here](https://www.self.com/story/to-acetone-or-not-the-healthie) for more.
- For those feeling a little fancy, consider a "Cutex Twist & Scrub Sponge" or an "up&up dip-it". These are large jars into which you can insert your nail, twist it against plastic brushes, and emerge with a polish-free nail (similar to a car wash).

##### Nail Files
- Most nail files found at your local drugstore or retail store will be effective at their job.
- Some recommended types of nail files include emery boards, wooden nail files, or glass/crystal nail files.
- Metal nail files are *not* recommended.

### Nail Art Tools

##### Nail Art Brushes/Dotters
- You can either purchase nail-specific brushes or purchase normal paint brushes and trim them to be thinner if necessary (watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxKpcv43FtI) to see how to trim brushes).
- If you are purchasing nail-specific brushes, you should be able to find tools which have a brush on one end and a dotter tool on the other.
- In this course, and in general, you will most likely only need liner brushes, also known as detail brushes (watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiDoItDlFRg) to the different types of nail art brushes and what designs they can create).

### Household Items

##### Makeup Sponges (a.k.a. Nail Art Soft Sponge)
- Any cheap makeup sponge will do! You can buy them in bulk online.
